# React Weather

React application that fetches weather data from http://openweathermap.org 
and displays current weather and a forecast for the upcoming five days.

Just type the city that you want the weather for and enjoy (at least if weather is any good).

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/snichme/react-weather.git
cd react-weather
npm install
npm start
```

## TODO

* Tests
* Heroku app, how? 
* Write readme
